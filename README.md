# Workspace

Based on Laradock Workspace

- PHP 7.4
- composer
- ssh


## SSH

Keys needed to access Workspace from the terminal. Not sure why we would need to copy the private key yet..

## Crontabs

Could be added like in original but now we use crontab job. There is also PHP Worker with supervisord.
