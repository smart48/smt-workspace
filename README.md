# Workspace

Based on Laradock Workspace

- PHP 7.4
- composer
- ssh


## SSH

Keys needed to access Workspace from the terminal. Not sure why we would need to copy the private key yet. Also, if we want this image to stay public we cannot built with private keys.

## Crontabs

Could be added like in original but now we use crontab job. There is also PHP Worker with supervisord.
